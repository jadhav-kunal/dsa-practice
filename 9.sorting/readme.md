## Rules

1. Insertion sort should be used when input length is small or items are nearly sorted. It uses very little space. Easy to implement.
2. Bubble sort is not going to be used mostly
3. Selection sort - not used
4. Merge sort is good - O(nlogn). Use if you're worried about worst case scenario. Space complexity O(n)
5. Quick sort has avg (nlogn) and space complexity O(logn) . Worst is O(n^2). Use if not worried of worst case
